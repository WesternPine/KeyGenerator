# KeyGenerator

KeyGenerator is a very basic secp256k1 key-pair generator. In this particular instance/use-case and more specifically, I am referring to Bitcoin wallets.

Running this program will produce 2 base-58 64-bit keys. The first key labeled as `Private Key` Is typically the key you never show or tell anyone. The next key generated would be the `Public Key` and is usually the key you give out to others.

In the case of Bitcoin, the private key would your personal identitifier that you could use to sell/trade any funds you had. While the public key would be the address that others could send this virtual curreny to, that would availible for you to use via your private key. Even though this is a VERY rough description, I produced a video walk-trhough, along with links and guides to everything you would need to know!
